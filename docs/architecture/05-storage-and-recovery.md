# Storage and Recovery

Defines durable state model and restart behavior.

## Durable state

- WAL/log segments
- Checkpoints / snapshots
- Control metadata

The first implemented local WAL segment format stores the flushed WAL prefix in a single checksummed file. Each record carries `txn_id`, payload length, payload bytes, and a record checksum. `Engine::persist_durable_wal_to_file(...)` writes the current durable prefix, and `Engine::recover_from_durable_wal_file(...)` replays that prefix through the normal engine commit/apply path so relational catalog entries, MVCC table rows, and volatile equality indexes are rebuilt from committed records only.

## Recovery sequence

1. Validate control metadata
2. Identify redo start
3. Replay log to committed boundary
4. Rebuild volatile caches (GPU) from durable state
5. Open for traffic after readiness gates pass

Current limitation: checkpoint metadata and control-file selection are not persisted yet. Operators should treat the checked-in file-backed path as a restart/replay proof for one explicit WAL segment, not as packaged PITR or automatic segment discovery.

## Compaction/snapshot boundary

Compaction may only remove entries older than a safe snapshot boundary known to all required consumers.

## MVCC Version Retention

Current bootstrap storage keeps all MVCC tuple versions needed by active snapshots. `Engine::checkpoint_vacuum_mvcc_versions(...)` provides the first safe local pruning boundary: it removes tuple versions whose `deleted_by` transaction is at or before a caller-provided safe transaction id, but only when that id is non-zero, does not cross the oldest active transaction, and is no newer than the flushed WAL checkpoint metadata.

This is intentionally a tuple-version vacuum, not a packaged checkpoint/control-file system. The durable WAL prefix remains the recovery source of truth, so file-backed WAL replay can reconstruct historical versions that were pruned from a running process. Relational equality-index entries remain volatile and are rebuilt from WAL replay; do not manually prune relational row keys or index entries outside the engine-owned vacuum boundary.

## Integrity

- Checksums on log records are implemented for the first local WAL segment format
- Data-page checksums remain future checkpoint/storage work
- Corruption detection and fail-safe behavior
