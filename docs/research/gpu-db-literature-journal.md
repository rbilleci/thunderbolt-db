# GPU DB Literature Journal

This journal synthesizes research papers for GPU database engine design. It is
maintained by the scheduled literature-review loop while GPU benchmarking is
paused or limited.

## Current Research Goals

- Maximize write throughput without weakening WAL-before-visibility or
  SQL-visible MVCC semantics.
- Maximize retained and over-resident read throughput.
- Prepare a runtime architecture that can plausibly scale toward 1M logical
  concurrent sessions through multiplexed IO, bounded queues, and admission
  control.
- Minimize query latency while still using GPU batching where it pays.
- Evaluate MVCC, snapshot isolation, virtual snapshots, RCU-like retained read
  snapshots, or comparable visibility models for this engine.
- Produce benchmarkable implementation candidates rather than only prose.

## Standing Synthesis

The current architecture target, as of `docs/architecture/11-high-throughput-query-runtime.md`,
is:

- async/network IO workers instead of one OS thread per client
- bounded command and response rings
- explicit owner domains for mutation, catalog, residency, GPU execution, and
  optional partitions
- immutable retained read snapshots for concurrent read execution
- GPU execution workers that own CUDA streams, events, pinned buffers, and
  scratch buffers
- micro-batching under latency ceilings for same-shape lookups, aggregates,
  COPY admission, refresh, and response metadata
- explicit backpressure at each queue or memory boundary

Each paper entry should either strengthen, revise, or reject part of that
target.

### 2026-06-02 - Concurrent Analytical Query Processing with GPUs

**Relevance tags:** GPU execution/batching; read throughput; concurrency/session
scale; latency; data layout/storage; admission/backpressure.

**Core idea:** GPU analytical queries often reserve far more device memory than
they actively use and leave copy engines and compute units idle during CPU
phases, dependencies, and operator transitions. Instead of treating a GPU as a
dedicated accelerator for one query, MultiQx-GPU lets compatible analytical
queries make concurrent progress while a database-level scheduler and
device-memory manager prevent resource conflicts from collapsing throughput.

The reported benefit is throughput rather than single-query latency isolation:
for 69 SSB query pairs whose peak device memory exceeded device capacity,
MultiQx-GPU improved throughput by 39% on average and up to 55% over dedicated
YDB execution at scale factor 14. At scale factor 28, the paper reports 33%
average and 54% maximum improvement. The authors also show why naive
co-running is unsafe: without scheduling, four concurrent queries dropped
throughput to one quarter of the optimum and 65% below one-at-a-time execution
in their experiment.

**Concrete mechanisms:**

- Query scheduling is modeled as admission control over effective GPU resource
  demand, not peak reservation. The paper defines weighted device-memory demand
  as a time-weighted average over the query's operator sequence, where each
  operator contributes its execution time and the maximum device memory
  referenced by any kernel in that operator.
- The scheduler dynamically updates a running query's weighted demand as phases
  change. A postponed query is reconsidered whenever a running query changes
  demand or finishes.
- The device-memory manager intercepts GPU API calls in application space. It
  returns host-side virtual regions first and allocates device memory only when
  a kernel that references the region is about to run.
- Lazy transfer keeps copied input in a host swapping buffer until the data is
  actually needed by a kernel. A copy-on-write optimization can avoid copying
  from the swapping buffer when the original source buffer has not changed.
- Large GPU regions are tracked as fixed-size logical pages for coherence, so
  partial updates and canceled evictions do not force whole-region movement.
- Kernel-level data reference and access advice tells the memory manager which
  regions the next kernel will touch and whether each region is input, output,
  or both. That avoids loading or preserving data that the kernel cannot read
  later.
- Cost-driven replacement (CDR) chooses eviction victims using a cost formula
  that combines bytes that must be copied back, region size, LRU position, and
  a latency factor. In the paper's selected co-running workloads, CDR improves
  throughput 44% on average and 56% at maximum versus LRU.
- The prototype uses `LD_PRELOAD` to intercept CUDA calls, a shared-memory area
  for cross-query state, POSIX message queues for replacement requests, and an
  8 MB logical page size that the paper says preserved over 99% PCIe efficiency.

**GPU DB mapping:** This strongly supports the current plan in
`11-high-throughput-query-runtime.md` to treat GPU execution workers and
residency state as explicit owner domains with bounded admission. The most
transferable idea is not full transparent swapping; it is phase-aware admission
based on measured effective resource demand. For this engine, retained read
workers should expose per-shape demand vectors such as resident bytes touched,
scratch bytes, pinned staging bytes, expected H2D/D2H bytes, kernel count, and
historical execution time. The scheduler can then co-run same-generation reads
only while the sum of effective demand stays inside per-GPU memory, copy-engine,
and scratch-buffer budgets.

The access-advice mechanism maps naturally onto planner route metadata. A
retained route already knows selected columns, predicate columns, aggregate
scratch, output shape, and whether it needs H2D key vectors or only device-side
resident columns. Making that metadata explicit before enqueueing work would
let the GPU execution owner decide whether a query is eligible for immediate
execution, micro-batching, CPU fallback, or overload rejection.

For P8 storage, the paper argues against over-relying on peak resident memory as
the scheduler's sole gate. Published immutable resident snapshots can reserve a
large table or partition while individual query shapes touch only a subset of
columns and scratch. Admission should count the snapshot's fixed residency
budget separately from each request's incremental execution footprint.

**Risks and mismatches:** MultiQx-GPU targets long-running analytical SSB
queries in a process-per-query YDB-style runtime, not SQL-visible pgwire
sessions, MVCC reads, or write-heavy workloads. Its transparent device-memory
swapping could harm the current engine's low-latency retained paths if it
reintroduced unpredictable H2D/D2H movement after residency has already been
published. The paper does not solve WAL-before-visibility, snapshot
compatibility, DDL invalidation, or response-ring backpressure. It also reports
throughput benefits under two-way analytical co-running, not million-session
network concurrency.

**Benchmark candidates:**

- Implement a retained-read demand estimator for existing partitioned retained
  routes: resident bytes referenced, scratch bytes, H2D key/predicate bytes,
  D2H result bytes, kernel count, and last observed CUDA time. Gate pass/fail on
  truthful telemetry with no route correctness changes.
- Compare fixed concurrency caps with weighted-demand admission for same-shape
  retained reads at concurrency `1,2,4,8,16,32,64`. Expected improvement:
  higher throughput once mixed query shapes arrive without increasing p95 queue
  wait. Failure condition: p50 latency regresses for single-request execution or
  admission hides overload.
- Add planner/executor access advice for retained routes and measure whether
  scratch/pinned-buffer reuse and route grouping reduce H2D/D2H bytes and launch
  overhead. Minimum proof gate: output per request includes the predicted versus
  observed demand vector.
- Stress incompatible retained query mixes to find the concurrency point where
  effective-demand admission must reject, fallback to CPU, or drain smaller
  micro-batches. This should be measured without adding transparent GPU memory
  swapping first.

### 2026-06-02 - Data Path Fusion in GPU for Analytical Query Processing

**Citation:** Tsuyoshi Ozawa and Kazuo Goda. "Data Path Fusion in GPU
for Analytical Query Processing." arXiv:2605.10511, submitted 2026-05-11.
Retrieved 2026-06-02 from `https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.10511`. The
preprint contains PVLDB placeholder metadata; final venue details are unknown.

**Relevance tags:** GPU execution/batching; read throughput; query latency;
data layout/storage; GPU IO; compression; retained/over-resident execution.

**Core idea:** Data Path Fusion argues that GPU analytical engines lose a large
part of their advantage when IO, decompression, and relational operators are
split into separate host-orchestrated GPU kernels. DPF instead makes a fused
CUDA kernel the data-path unit: the kernel issues GPU-initiated storage reads,
decompresses pages, and runs filters, hash probes/builds, or aggregation before
returning control to the host.

The most important shift for this engine is treating "resident read execution"
as a fully described pipeline rather than a sequence of local optimizations.
DPF's gains come from removing host-device synchronization boundaries,
eliminating intermediate materialization between stages, and making compression
formats match GPU thread-level decompression. In the reported representative
configuration, DPF improves end-to-end response over a GOLAP-like baseline by
2.66x to 6.22x on selected TPC-H queries and 3.84x to 16.81x on selected SSB
queries.

**Concrete mechanisms:**

- Each fused kernel combines BaM-based GPU-initiated IO, page decompression, and
  one or more relational operations. The host still generates the query plan and
  launches kernels, but does not orchestrate each IO/decompression/operator
  stage.
- A GPU-side pruning stage uses dictionaries and zone maps to produce pruned
  page lists before the fused query kernels run.
- Thread blocks advance through IO, decompression, and operation stages with
  synchronization barriers inside the kernel. The IO stage can dedicate a subset
  of warps to BaM request submission and completion polling, while all threads
  participate in decompression and operator work.
- Kernel launch configuration is tuned per query. The paper describes using
  one block per SM with 128 threads for typical cases, and larger blocks such as
  1,024 threads when more IO warps or compute parallelism are useful.
- Column grouping is a scheduling choice. Related columns from the same table
  can be read and decompressed together so decoded values co-reside in shared
  memory where possible, avoiding global-memory intermediates before operator
  execution.
- Fixed-length integer columns use GPU-FOR-style mini-block compression, with
  metadata for base value, bit width, and byte offset. Short fixed strings are
  reinterpreted as integers; longer strings use the variable-length path.
- Variable-length strings use FSST per page plus embedded row ids and an
  auxiliary RID prefix-sum index so kernels can locate the page for a row id and
  align pages across columns.
- The loader sorts rows, builds zone maps, writes compressed column pages in two
  passes, and records page offset, page size, and row-count prefix arrays. The
  paper reports additional loading cost within 1.5% versus the baseline layouts
  it evaluates.
- Evaluation isolates components: BaM alone improves TPC-H query response by
  1.12x to 1.51x versus CPU-initiated GDS in their setup, kernel fusion adds
  mixed effects on TPC-H but 1.17x to 3.97x on SSB, and type-specific
  compression provides the largest additional speedup in many cases by reducing
  IO volume and making decompression fine-grained.

**GPU DB mapping:** DPF is most directly applicable to the P8 retained and
over-resident read path, not the current SQL-visible write path. Existing
partitioned retained routes already avoid repeated H2D recopy for resident
columns, but they are still shaped as separate planning, staging, kernel, and
materialization steps. The transferable direction is a route descriptor that
can generate a single fused retained kernel for a stable query family: load key
or predicate vectors if needed, touch resident column groups, evaluate
visibility/predicate logic, reduce or scatter results, and write compact
per-request output buffers.

For over-resident tables, DPF supports a stronger version of the current P8
partition model: partition-local compressed column pages plus zone maps can be
fed by GPU-initiated IO only for pages whose min/max metadata survives pruning.
That would give the engine an explicit third read mode between fully resident
device memory and CPU fallback: GPU-in-data-path cold or warm page execution.
It should remain subordinate to SQL visibility, so the page metadata would need
relation identity, schema generation, source WAL boundary, and visibility
boundary just like resident snapshots.

The compression mechanism also maps to P8's `int4`/`text` first slice. Dense
`int4` resident buffers are good for today's kernels, but over-resident
execution should benchmark GPU-FOR-like compressed page groups for scan-heavy
aggregates. The string/RID design is relevant to future `text LIKE 'prefix%'`
routes because it makes variable-length pages independently decodable by GPU
thread blocks.

**Risks and mismatches:** DPF is an analytical engine prototype, not a
PostgreSQL-compatible MVCC serving runtime. It does not address WAL-before-
visibility, DDL invalidation, snapshot retirement, pgwire response rings, or
session concurrency. The fused kernels can become query-family-specific and may
increase implementation complexity compared with the current narrow retained
route kernels. BaM also assumes raw block-device access and GPU-initiated IO;
that may not be available or desirable in the first production deployment.
Build-side joins are limited by GPU memory, the prototype supports only selected
compression schemes, and general decimal/floating-point support is incomplete.

**Benchmark candidates:**

- Build a "route-fusion" telemetry proof for one retained aggregate family:
  count host/device synchronization points, kernel launches, intermediate
  buffers, H2D/D2H bytes, and CUDA elapsed time before and after combining
  predicate, visibility, and reduction into fewer kernels. Minimum gate:
  identical SQL-visible result and lower launch/materialization count.
- Add compressed resident-page experiments for `int4` aggregate scans using a
  GPU-FOR-like page group beside the current dense resident layout. Expected
  improvement: lower memory traffic or over-resident IO volume. Failure
  condition: decompression overhead loses to dense scans at current row counts.
- Prototype partition-local zone-map pruning for over-resident read planning:
  route only candidate pages/partitions to GPU execution and record pruned
  bytes, touched bytes, and result correctness. Minimum gate: stable pruning
  metadata tied to source WAL and schema generation.
- For future `text` retained routes, test an FSST/RID-index page layout against
  the current offsets-plus-bytes resident representation for prefix predicates.
  Measure decode bandwidth, output scatter cost, and memory footprint.
- Treat GPU-initiated IO as a later-stage benchmark, not an immediate
  dependency. First compare fused retained kernels over already-resident data;
  then evaluate GPUDirect/BaM-style over-resident execution only if storage IO
  becomes the measured bottleneck.
