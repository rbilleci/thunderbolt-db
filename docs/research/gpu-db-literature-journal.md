# GPU DB Literature Journal

This journal synthesizes research papers for GPU database engine design. It is
maintained by the scheduled literature-review loop while GPU benchmarking is
paused or limited.

## Current Research Goals

- Maximize write throughput without weakening WAL-before-visibility or
  SQL-visible MVCC semantics.
- Maximize retained and over-resident read throughput.
- Prepare a runtime architecture that can plausibly scale toward 1M logical
  concurrent sessions through multiplexed IO, bounded queues, and admission
  control.
- Minimize query latency while still using GPU batching where it pays.
- Evaluate MVCC, snapshot isolation, virtual snapshots, RCU-like retained read
  snapshots, or comparable visibility models for this engine.
- Produce benchmarkable implementation candidates rather than only prose.

## Standing Synthesis

The current architecture target, as of `docs/architecture/11-high-throughput-query-runtime.md`,
is:

- async/network IO workers instead of one OS thread per client
- bounded command and response rings
- explicit owner domains for mutation, catalog, residency, GPU execution, and
  optional partitions
- immutable retained read snapshots for concurrent read execution
- GPU execution workers that own CUDA streams, events, pinned buffers, and
  scratch buffers
- micro-batching under latency ceilings for same-shape lookups, aggregates,
  COPY admission, refresh, and response metadata
- explicit backpressure at each queue or memory boundary

Each paper entry should either strengthen, revise, or reject part of that
target.

**Relevance tags:** GPU execution/batching; read throughput; concurrency/session

**Core idea:** GPU analytical queries often reserve far more device memory than
they actively use and leave copy engines and compute units idle during CPU
phases, dependencies, and operator transitions. Instead of treating a GPU as a
dedicated accelerator for one query, MultiQx-GPU lets compatible analytical
queries make concurrent progress while a database-level scheduler and
device-memory manager prevent resource conflicts from collapsing throughput.

The reported benefit is throughput rather than single-query latency isolation:
for 69 SSB query pairs whose peak device memory exceeded device capacity,
MultiQx-GPU improved throughput by 39% on average and up to 55% over dedicated
YDB execution at scale factor 14. At scale factor 28, the paper reports 33%
average and 54% maximum improvement. The authors also show why naive
co-running is unsafe: without scheduling, four concurrent queries dropped
throughput to one quarter of the optimum and 65% below one-at-a-time execution
in their experiment.

**Concrete mechanisms:**

- Query scheduling is modeled as admission control over effective GPU resource
  demand, not peak reservation. The paper defines weighted device-memory demand
  as a time-weighted average over the query's operator sequence, where each
  operator contributes its execution time and the maximum device memory
  referenced by any kernel in that operator.
- The scheduler dynamically updates a running query's weighted demand as phases
  change. A postponed query is reconsidered whenever a running query changes
  demand or finishes.
- The device-memory manager intercepts GPU API calls in application space. It
  returns host-side virtual regions first and allocates device memory only when
  a kernel that references the region is about to run.
- Lazy transfer keeps copied input in a host swapping buffer until the data is
  actually needed by a kernel. A copy-on-write optimization can avoid copying
  from the swapping buffer when the original source buffer has not changed.
- Large GPU regions are tracked as fixed-size logical pages for coherence, so
  partial updates and canceled evictions do not force whole-region movement.
- Kernel-level data reference and access advice tells the memory manager which
  regions the next kernel will touch and whether each region is input, output,
  or both. That avoids loading or preserving data that the kernel cannot read
  later.
- Cost-driven replacement (CDR) chooses eviction victims using a cost formula
  that combines bytes that must be copied back, region size, LRU position, and
  a latency factor. In the paper's selected co-running workloads, CDR improves
  throughput 44% on average and 56% at maximum versus LRU.
- The prototype uses `LD_PRELOAD` to intercept CUDA calls, a shared-memory area
  for cross-query state, POSIX message queues for replacement requests, and an
  8 MB logical page size that the paper says preserved over 99% PCIe efficiency.

**GPU DB mapping:** This strongly supports the current plan in
`11-high-throughput-query-runtime.md` to treat GPU execution workers and
residency state as explicit owner domains with bounded admission. The most
transferable idea is not full transparent swapping; it is phase-aware admission
based on measured effective resource demand. For this engine, retained read
workers should expose per-shape demand vectors such as resident bytes touched,
scratch bytes, pinned staging bytes, expected H2D/D2H bytes, kernel count, and
historical execution time. The scheduler can then co-run same-generation reads
only while the sum of effective demand stays inside per-GPU memory, copy-engine,
and scratch-buffer budgets.

The access-advice mechanism maps naturally onto planner route metadata. A
retained route already knows selected columns, predicate columns, aggregate
scratch, output shape, and whether it needs H2D key vectors or only device-side
resident columns. Making that metadata explicit before enqueueing work would
let the GPU execution owner decide whether a query is eligible for immediate
execution, micro-batching, CPU fallback, or overload rejection.

For P8 storage, the paper argues against over-relying on peak resident memory as
the scheduler's sole gate. Published immutable resident snapshots can reserve a
large table or partition while individual query shapes touch only a subset of
columns and scratch. Admission should count the snapshot's fixed residency
budget separately from each request's incremental execution footprint.

**Risks and mismatches:** MultiQx-GPU targets long-running analytical SSB
queries in a process-per-query YDB-style runtime, not SQL-visible pgwire
sessions, MVCC reads, or write-heavy workloads. Its transparent device-memory
swapping could harm the current engine's low-latency retained paths if it
reintroduced unpredictable H2D/D2H movement after residency has already been
published. The paper does not solve WAL-before-visibility, snapshot
compatibility, DDL invalidation, or response-ring backpressure. It also reports
throughput benefits under two-way analytical co-running, not million-session
network concurrency.

**Benchmark candidates:**

- Implement a retained-read demand estimator for existing partitioned retained
  routes: resident bytes referenced, scratch bytes, H2D key/predicate bytes,
  D2H result bytes, kernel count, and last observed CUDA time. Gate pass/fail on
  truthful telemetry with no route correctness changes.
- Compare fixed concurrency caps with weighted-demand admission for same-shape
  retained reads at concurrency `1,2,4,8,16,32,64`. Expected improvement:
  higher throughput once mixed query shapes arrive without increasing p95 queue
  wait. Failure condition: p50 latency regresses for single-request execution or
  admission hides overload.
- Add planner/executor access advice for retained routes and measure whether
  scratch/pinned-buffer reuse and route grouping reduce H2D/D2H bytes and launch
  overhead. Minimum proof gate: output per request includes the predicted versus
  observed demand vector.
- Stress incompatible retained query mixes to find the concurrency point where
  effective-demand admission must reject, fallback to CPU, or drain smaller
  micro-batches. This should be measured without adding transparent GPU memory
  swapping first.
